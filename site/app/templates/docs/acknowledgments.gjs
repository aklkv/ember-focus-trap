<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/davidtheclark">@davidtheclark</a> for creating <a href="https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap">focus-trap</a>.
This addon was only made possible by his work on the underlying library we use.</p>
<p>I acknowledgments that most of the examples and wording of this documentation
was inspired/copied from his work. In addition, I used his React component to
guide the implementation of the modifier.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the Ember folks as well for making modifiers possible.</p>
